    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Paella is a rice dish originally from Valencia. While non-Spaniards 
        commonly view it as Spain's national dish,[citation needed] Spaniards 
        almost unanimously consider it to be a dish from the Valencian region.

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Heat Olive oil </strong> - Heat the olive oil in a large

        <li><strong>Add Ingredients</strong> - Add the smoked paprika, 
            thyme and paella rice, stir for 1 min, then splash in the sherry, 
            if using. Once evaporated, stir in the chopped tomatoes and chicken 
            stock.</li>

        <li><strong>Season and Cook</strong> - Season and cook, uncovered, 
            for about 15 mins, stirring now and again until the rice is 
            almost tender and still surrounded with some liquid. </li>

        <li><strong>Make patties or balls</strong> -  Once the falafel mixture has 
            been plenty chilled, stir in baking powder and toasted sesame seeds, 
            then scoop golf ball-sized balls and form into balls or patties </li>
            
        <li><strong>Stir seafood mix</strong> - Stir in the seafood mix and cover 
            with a lid. Simmer for 5 mins, or until the seafood is cooked through 
            and the rice is tender. Squeeze over the lemon juice, scatter over 
            the parsley and serve with the lemon wedges.</li>
