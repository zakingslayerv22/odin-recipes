        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Boil the Carrots, Potatoes, & Eggs</strong> - In a 
                large pot, boil the carrots and potatoes until they are easily 
                pierced with a fork. Next, boil the eggs. Set the ingredients 
                aside to cool at room temperature.</li>

            <li><strong>Dice the Salad Ingredients</strong> - With a sharp 
                knife, dice the onions, carrots, potatoes, eggs, and bologna/ham 
                into small cubes. In a large bowl, mixed the finely diced ingredients 
                with the peas. Stir with a spoon until well-combined.</li>

            <li><strong>Season and Cook</strong> - Season and cook, uncovered, 
                for about 15 mins, stirring now and again until the rice is 
                almost tender and still surrounded with some liquid. </li>

            <li><strong>Toss with Dressing</strong> - Toss the salad ingredients 
                with the mayo and season to taste with salt and pepper. Optionally, 
                you can sprinkle in some fresh dill for a pop of flavor and color. 
                Enjoy! </li>

        </ol>
